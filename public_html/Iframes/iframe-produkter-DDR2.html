        <h3>DDR2-SDRAM</h3>
        <p align="left" title="DDR2-SDRAM">
            <font face="Calibri">DDR2 SDRAM is a double data rate 
            synchronous dynamic random-access memory interface. It superseded the original DDR 
            SDRAM specification, and has since been superseded by DDR3 SDRAM. DDR2 DIMMs are 
            neither forward compatible with DDR3 nor backward compatible with DDR.<br>
            In addition to double pumping the data bus as in DDR SDRAM (transferring data on 
            the rising and falling edges of the bus clock signal), DDR2 allows higher bus speed
            and requires lower power by running the internal clock at half the speed of the data 
            bus. The two factors combine to produce a total of four data transfers per internal
            clock cycle. With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR2 SDRAM gives a transfer
            rate of (memory clock rate) × 2 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 
            (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock 
            frequency of 100 MHz, DDR2 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 3200 MB/s.<br>Since 
            the DDR2 internal clock runs at half the DDR external clock rate, DDR2 memory 
            operating at the same external data bus clock rate as DDR results in DDR2 being 
            able to provide the same bandwidth but with higher latency. Alternatively, DDR2 memory
            operating at twice the external data bus clock rate as DDR may provide twice the 
            bandwidth with the same latency. The best-rated DDR2 memory modules are at least twice 
            as fast as the best-rated DDR memory modules.
