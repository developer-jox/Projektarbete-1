        <h3>DDR3-SDRAM</h3>
        <p align="left" title="DDR3-SDRAM"><font face="Calibri"><strong>The primary benefit of DDR3 SDRAM</strong> over its immediate predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, 
        is its ability to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its
        internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two 
        transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may 
        achieve a transfer rate of up to 64 times the memory clock speed megahertz (MHz) 
        in megabytes per second (MB/s). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per 
        memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus 
        clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number 
        of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100 MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum 
        transfer rate of <cite>6400 MB/s.</cite> In addition, the DDR3 standard permits DRAM chip capacities
        of up to 8 gigabits.</font></p>
