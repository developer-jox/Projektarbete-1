        <h3>DDR-SDRAM</h3>
        <p align="left" title="DDR-SDRAM"><font face="Calibri"><strong>Double data rate synchronous 
        dynamic random-access memory (DDR SDRAM)</strong>is a class of memory integrated circuits 
        used in computers. DDR SDRAM, also called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by DDR2 SDRAM and
        DDR3 SDRAM. Neither of its successors are forward or backward compatible with DDR1 SDRAM,
        meaning DDR2 or DDR3 memory modules will<em> not work </em>in DDR1-equipped motherboards, and vice 
        versa.<br>With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate of
        (memory bus clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of 
        bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100 MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 
        1600 MB/s.</font></p>
