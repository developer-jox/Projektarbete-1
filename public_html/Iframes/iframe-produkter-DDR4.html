        <h3>DDR4-SDRAM</h3>
        <p align="left" title="DDR4-SDRAM">
            <font face="Calibri">In computing, DDR4 SDRAM, an abbreviation for 
            double data rate fourth generation synchronous dynamic random-access
            memory, is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM)
            with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface. It was released 
            to the market in 2014. It is one of the latest variants of 
            dynamic random access memory (DRAM), some of which have been in use
            since the early 1970s, and a proposed higher-speed successor to 
            the DDR2 and DDR3 technologies. It is not compatible with any earlier
            type of random access memory (RAM) due to different signaling voltages,
            physical interface and other factors. It was released to the public 
            market in Q2 2014 with a focus on ECC memory,and an anticipated
            launch for non-ECC modules in Q3 2014.
