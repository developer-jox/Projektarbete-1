        <h3>HBM</h3>
        <p title="HBM">
            <font face="Calibri">HBM is another emerging memory standard defined by the JEDEC 
            organization. HBM was developed as a revolutionary upgrade for graphics applications.
            GDDR5 was defined to support 28 GBps (7 Gbps x32). Expected to be available in mass 
            production in 2015, the standard applies to stacked DRAM die, and is built on Wide 
            I/O and TSV technologies to support bandwidth from 128GB/s to 256GB/s. JEDECâ€™s HBM 
            task force is now part of the JC-42.3 Subcommittee, which continues to work to 
            define support for up to 8-high TSV stacks of memory on a 1,024-bits wide data 
            interface.
