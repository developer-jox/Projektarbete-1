        <h3>GDDR5</h3>
        <p align="left" title="GDDR5">
            <font face="Calibri">GDDR5, an abbreviation for double data rate type
            five synchronous graphics random access memory, is a modern type of 
            synchronous graphics random access memory (SGRAM) with a high bandwidth 
            ("double data rate") interface designed for use in graphics cards, game 
            consoles, and high-performance computation. Like its predecessor, GDDR4,
            GDDR5 is based on DDR3 SDRAM memory which has double the data lines compared 
            to DDR2 SDRAM, but GDDR5 also has 8-bit wide prefetch buffers similar to GDDR4.
            GDDR5 SGRAM conforms to the standards which were set out in the GDDR5 specification
            by the JEDEC. SGRAM is single-ported. However, it can open two memory pages
            at once, which simulates the dual-port nature of other VRAM technologies. 
            It uses an 8n-prefetch architecture and DDR interface to achieve high performance
            operation and can be configured to operate in ×32 mode or ×16 (clamshell) 
            mode which is detected during device initialization. The GDDR5 interface 
            transfers two 32-bit wide data words per write clock (WCK) cycle to/from 
            the I/O pins. 
            <br><br>Corresponding to the 8n-prefetch, a single write or read access
            consists of a 256-bit wide two CK clock cycle data transfer at the internal 
            memory core and eight corresponding 32-bit wide one-half WCK clock cycle data 
            transfers at the I/O pins.GDDR5 operates with two different clock types. 
            A differential command clock (CK) as a reference for address and command 
            inputs, and a forwarded differential write clock (WCK) as a reference for 
            data reads and writes, that runs at twice the CK frequency. Being more precise,
            the GDDR5 SGRAM uses a total of three clocks: two write clocks associated with
            two bytes (WCK01 and WCK23) and a single command clock (CK). Taking a GDDR5 
            with 5 Gbit/s data rate per pin as an example, the CK clock runs with 1.25 
            GHz and both WCK clocks at 2.5 GHz. The CK and WCKs are phase aligned during
            the initialization and training sequence. This alignment allows read and write
            access with minimum latency.
