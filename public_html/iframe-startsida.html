                    <i>A computer is a general purpose 
                    device that can be programmed to carry out a set of
                    arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since
                    a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the
                    computer can solve more than one kind of problem. </i>
                    <sub>The processing element carriesout arithmetic and logic
                    operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the
                    order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral
                    devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, 
                    and the result of operations saved and retrieved.</sub>
                    In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used 
                    for specialized military applications. During this time 
                    the first electronic digital computers were developed.
                    Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming
                    as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).
                    <sup>Modern computers based on integrated circuits are 
                    millions to billions of times more capable than the early 
                    machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.</sup>

                        <i>
                            <b>Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath</b>
                        </i>
                    </sub>
                    originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered
                    the "father of the computer", he conceptualized and 
                    invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th
                    century. After working on his revolutionary difference 
                    engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 
                    1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical 
                    Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided 
                    to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete <br><br>
